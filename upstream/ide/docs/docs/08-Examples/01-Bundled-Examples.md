The installer replaces this complete examples folder during every upgrade or repair.
Create student projects elsewhere before changing an example.

For the conversation demo, run `generate_conversation_answers.py` once before
`voice_conversation.py`. See **Offline Voice Conversation** in this section.
The Local AI version loads STT, TTS, and Gemma once at startup. It needs a CodyJoy
Pro, USB microphone, speaker, and enough free memory for all three models.
